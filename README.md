Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.

Innovation has no limits. The only limit is your imagination. It's time for you to begin thinking out of the box. If you are involved in a growing industry, think of ways to become more efficient; more customer friendly; and easier to do business with. If you are involved in a shrinking industry – get out of it quick and change before you become obsolete; out of work; or out of business. And remember that procrastination is not an option here. Start innovating now!

创新无极限！只要敢想，没有什么不可能，立即跳出思维的框框吧。如果你正处于一个上升的朝阳行业，那么尝试去寻找更有效的解决方案：更招消费者喜爱、更简洁的商业模式。如果你处于一个日渐萎缩的行业，那么赶紧在自己变得跟不上时代之前抽身而出，去换个工作或者转换行业。不要拖延，立刻开始创新！
